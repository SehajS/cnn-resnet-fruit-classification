# CNN Model for Fruit Prediction

The Jupyter notebook is creates a Deep Learning CNN model using PyTorch which aims at classifying fruits from their images. There are 131 different types of fruits in the dataset. 

The dataset has been obtained from Kaggle and can be accessed  from this link: [https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits)
Reasonable explanations via the usage of markdown and python comments has been provided in the notebook.


##  Installing packages/libraries
The packages used in the code are <em>torch, torchvision, matplotlib, shutil, os and opendatasets</em>. While some of these are in-built in Python, others can be installed using <em>pip command</em>:

- <code>pip install torch</code>
- <code>pip install torchvision</code>
- <code>pip install shutil</code>
- <code>pip install opendatasets</code>

Alternatively, they all can be installed from Anacondas Navigator. Note that this project requires GPU power and thus cuda version for <em>torch</em> must be installed on your machine. If GPU is not available, one can run the notebook on Google Collab and utilize GPU there. 


## Running the Jupyter Notebook
One has to open the Jupyter notebook and then just run every cell by pressing <code>shift + return</code>.
